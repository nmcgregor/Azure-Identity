# Planning and Selecting Azure AD Identity Neil Neil

Use the information in this section to determine the Identity pattern characteristics that best fit your current, or future user access requirements.  

An Azure AD Identity pattern is a model configuration. Match your organizational structure or requirements to an Azure AD Identity pattern and use the pattern to build an application appropriate for your needs.

Planning and selecting the Azure AD authentication pattern is a two-stage process:
	1. Review and choose the Identity pattern you want to use
	2. Implement the Azure AD authentication pattern based on the Identity pattern you have chosen (see Guidance below)



Guidance
Use the following supplemental information when considering an Identity and authentication pattern.

	• Determine your Organization's  Azure AD Identity Business Requirements. 
	
	• For summary information on how to select your Azure AD authentication pattern, see: Selecting Your Azure AD Authentication Implementation Pattern.

	• When building a cloud environment, an organization must ensure their subscription services have a common cloud directory that is synchronized or federated with their own on-premises directory. Azure AD can synchronize user Identities from Azure AD Domain Services (DS); an organization does not need to manage Identities separately in the two environments. This capability creates a directory continuum from an organization's on-premises AD to all  subscribed Microsoft services.

	• Determining Identity Requirements for Your Hybrid Solution:  Plan and select an identity solution to determine the identity requirements that the business organization will be using to leverage the hybrid solution.
	
	• Determining Directory Synchronization Requirements: Evaluate your organization's on-premise identity solution and user requirements. 

	• Using the Native Cloud Identity Pattern: Use the Cloud Identity Pattern if your organization does not have an existing, on-premise source directory. 

	• Using the Sync + Hash Hybrid Identity Pattern:  Use the Sync + Hash Hybrid Identity Pattern to enable user access to resources for organizations who do not have specific, on-premise or cloud password storage constraints or policies.

	• Using the Sync + ADFS Hybrid Identity Pattern:  Use the Sync + ADFS Hybrid Identity Pattern for organizations with security and compliance policy restrictions.

	• Using the Sync + Pass-thru Authentication Hybrid Identity Pattern:  Use the Sync + Pass-thru Authentication Hybrid Identity Pattern for organizations with security and compliance policy restrictions.
